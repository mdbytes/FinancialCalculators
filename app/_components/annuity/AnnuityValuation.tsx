        An annuity is a series of payments made at equal intervals over a
        determined period of time. The payments can be made monthly or annually
        into an investment vehicle for a period of time, or the payments can be
        received by a beneficiary for a period of time. Banks, insurance and
        investment companies all offer a wide range of annuities. Annuities can
        also represent streams of income, such as payouts from an investment or
        reverse mortgage over time.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we focus on valuation of two simple annuity forms which provide a
        foundation for evaluating all of the other types of annuities.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Annuity Investment:</b> You are the investor and your annuity
          investment is represented by a periodic investment of a fixed sum over
          a determined period of time, such as annual deposits to a savings
          account or money market fund. What will the value be at the end of the
          road?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Annuity Income:</b> You are the recipient of a fixed stream of
          payments over a period of time, which is becoming a more common
          scenario as our population ages. In a reverse mortgage, as a common
          example, what is a fair value for the promised stream of income?
        </li>
      </ul>
