                    Every Development Service will have five sequential phases,
                    initiation, build, delivery, revision, and deployment as
                    follows;
                  </p>
                  <ol className="phase-list">
                    <li>
                      Initiation begins with Your initial purchase of a
                      Development Service, subsequent to which you will schedule
                      and participate in a development interview, in which;
                      <ol className="dev-interview">
                        <li>
                          Our representative will gather and clarify information
                          needed from You to complete the Development Service;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          You will provide content deemed necessary for the
                          production of the Development Service;
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          Initiation phase concludes with the approval of Your
                          content provided.
                        </li>
                      </ol>

                    <li>
                      Build phase begins upon approval of Your provided content.
                      During the build phase, We may have need to raise a
                      question or clarify issues. Questions or requests for
                      clarification will be sent by email. During build phase,
                      the development service will be hosted on Our development
                      server. Build phase concludes when the development service
                      has been built and initial tests have been concluded that
                      the service meets written functional requirements.

                      Delivery of the finished Development Service will begin
                      the date the Development Service is made available for
                      Your review on our development server. During this initial
                      delivery period, You will be given 10 days to review the
                      build of Your development service. Unless agreed upon in
                      writing, the delivery phase will end 10 days after initial
                      delivery notification.

                      Revision phase begins immediately after the delivery
                      phase. During revision, We will make revisions based on
                      Your review comments collected from the delivery phase.
                      These revisions will focus on;

                      Except as it relates to limitations stated below, the
                      revision phase ends once all necessary revisions have been
